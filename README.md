# Financial calculator

The purpose of the code in finance_calculators.py is to offer users two essential financial tools: an investment calculator and a bond repayment calculator. The investment calculator helps users determine the future value of their investments based on the type of interest—simple or compound—by inputting the deposit amount, interest rate, and investment duration. The bond repayment calculator calculates the monthly repayment amount for a home loan, using the present value of the house, annual interest rate, and repayment period. Both tools provide clear and formatted results to aid users in their financial planning and decision-making.
##  The Process📜

*Investment Calculation:*
- Simple Interest: Uses the formula = 𝐴=𝑃×(1+𝑟×𝑡)
A=P×(1+r×t) to compute the final amount where 𝑃
P is the principal, 𝑟
r is the annual interest rate (converted to a decimal), and 𝑡
t is the time in years.

- Compound Interest: Uses the formula 𝐴=𝑃×(1+𝑟)𝑡
A=P×(1+r) t
  to calculate the amount, with 𝑟
r as the annual interest rate divided by 100 and 𝑡
t as the time in years.

*Bond Repayment Calculation:*
- Computes the monthly repayment using 
repayment =𝑖×𝑃1−(1+𝑖)−𝑛
repayment= 1−(1+i) −n
i×P, where 𝑖
i is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12 and converted to a decimal), 
𝑃
P is the loan amount, and 𝑛
n is the number of months.
